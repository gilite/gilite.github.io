      Hi! I'm a Year 3 student studying Information Systems at Singapore
      Management University. I have a passion for building web applications and
      utility tools to aid development. I'm motivated by problem solving with
      real world needs, and the bouncing of meaningful ideas between like-minded
      friends.

      <br /><br />
      My main interests lie in web development, performance and UX design. I'm
      also a huge fan of keeping well-documented and clean codebases (TypeScript
      ftw!) and functional programming.

      <br /><br />
      When I'm not figuring out things in code, I spend some idle time checking
      out R&B or rock music (huge fan of John Mayer and Queen). In an alternate
      universe I'd like to be some sort of a music producer. And cook as a
      hobby.
